# NS2 - Network Simulator 2
A computer or telecommunications network consists of a series of equipments and infrastructure, the implementation of which on a commercial scale, usually involves significant time and costs. Therefore, before the actual implementation of the network, it is necessary to modeling and analysis the network to identify and resolve possible problems and inefficiencies. To do this, we need a tool that models and simulates network equipment and communications for us.

NS2 or Network Simulator 2 is an open source tool used by most research teams, students and network researchers to model, simulate, emulate, and analyze and evaluate network performance and network protocols. NS2 covers most common network protocols. Using network simulation with NS2, a network can be modeled before the actual implementation, and various network parameters can be changed in the simulation, and the simulation results can be evaluated and compared. After each network simulation with NS2, a series of statistics can be extracted from the simulation results. Statistics are actually parameters whose value is determined by performing each simulation. To learn more about NS2, you can enroll the NS2 Comprehensive Training course at this link:
